This repository contains complementary documents to the paper "Test Scenario Generation for Feature-Based Context-Oriented", by Pierre Martou, Kim Mens, Beno√Æt Duhoux and Axel Legay.

## Generation tool to generate and reorder test suites
This describes the content of folder *GenerationTool*.

- *generation_tool*: an executable that generates and reorders a test suite, just like described in the paper. The input should be a valid and complete context-feature model, described in three text files *features.txt*, *contexts.txt*, *mapping.txt*. 

- *features.txt*, *contexts.txt*, *mapping.txt*: these are valid input to the generation tool, and correspond to the case study used in the paper.

## Case study and design analysis

- *Annex-CaseStudyMessenger.pdf* : model of our case study

- *Annex-CompleteUsageScenario.pdf*: complete usage scenario and related design analysis on the case study

## Experiment

- *Annex-FullQuestionnaire.xlsx*: Contains all the questions and answers of the participants to the questionnaire.

- *participants-data*: For all pairs of participants, we provide the models (in valid format to be reused with the the tool *generation_tool*) as well as the design analysis performed using our testing approach (in pdf format).
